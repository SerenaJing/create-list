Each element in the positive integer sequence Q is at least divisible by one of the positive integers a and b, 

and given a and b, it is necessary to compute the first few of Q, 

for example, when a = 3, b = 5 , N = 6, the sequence is 3,5,6,9,10,12. 

(1) Design a function void generate (int a, int b, int N, int * Q) Calculate the first few items of Q. 

(2), design test data to verify the correctness of the function program under various inputs.
